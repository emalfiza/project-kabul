Kabul, Afghanistan located in the heart of Asia. Termed as the roof of the world. On the google search, type Kabul and the only things will pop up is desttructions and graphic images, But that is not the real image of it. City of Kabul website is present to manifest and standout the real beauty and rich culture of Asia and to attract global tourists. The website is consist of four pages.

My goal in the design was to create simple, clear website and make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. 

For users, I wanted to provide them with a very breif overview of Kabul and its culture via a simple and friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of what and how Kabul is, the history, culture and the transitions, with the option to contact if they chose. In the footer section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access the social media for Kabul.

The Overall idea  of the website was intended by myself. The landing page background image is taken from the [wallpapercave](https://wallpapercave.com/kabul-wallpapers alt="_blank") and it showcase the thusands of olds history of Kabul. And on the about section the user could obtain the cultural traditions in Kabul, the tallest mosque in the city image is taken from the [twitter](https://twitter.com/sejavand/status/1119118340478226432/photo/1) and cultural foods of Kabul image is taken from the [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTbc17DuPJ/). Users are able to view the social media about Kabul via clicking on the icons in the footer. If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name field, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank".

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone  8plus: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

html codes were tested in w3c html validator and css codes were tested in w3c css validator.
